             On the eve of World War I, the future of Argentina seemed bright. From the adoption of the con
                stitution in 1853 to the onset of World War I, Argentina underwent a period of economic excep
                tionalism known as the Belle Époque.1 By 1896, Argentina achieved per capita income parity with 
                the United States and attained a considerably higher level of prosperity than France, Germany, 
                Italy, and Spain.2 Strong economic growth and institutional reforms positioned Argentina among 
                the top 10 countries by 1913 in terms of per capita GDP.3 Some scholars have called 19th-century 
                Buenos Aires “Chicago on Rio de la Plata,” given the historical similarities between both cities.4 
                Ninteenth century Buenos Aires boasted the highest literacy rates in Latin America,5 unprec
                edented European immigration,6 and rapid modernization of infrastructure.7
                It seems that Argentina briskly moved the “lever of riches” in less than half a century.8 In 1913, 
                Argentina’s per capita income stood at 72 percent of the US level.9 In 2010, Argentina achieved 
                barely a third of US level. In 1860, Argentina needed about 55 years to attain the per capita income 
                level of Switzerland. Today Argentina would need more than 90 years to achieve the Swiss level 
                of prosperity. How could a society that achieved astonishing wealth and splendor in less than 
                half a century move from being a developed country to being an underdeveloped one? The most 
                obvious question to ask is, What went wrong? The answer lies in a lack of inclusive and participa
                tory robust legal and institutional framework that would have prevented the reforms from being 
                undermined. A counterfactual experiment for Argentina suggests that institutional breakdowns 
                are a critical explanation in development narratives

                        Once achieved, broad-based economic development should hardly be taken for granted. The 
            benefits of development can be easily undermined if the institutional framework fails to sustain 
            secure property rights, low transaction costs, and a robust rule of law.10 The absence of such de 
            jure institutional framework and its de facto enforcement can easily slow economic growth and 
            result in stagnation.11
            In the broadest form, a de jure institutional framework captures the set of rules that allocates 
            political power via electoral law, the constitution, and legislation.12 On the other hand, de facto 
            institutional framework largely determines the distribution of economic resources. It also sets 
            constraints on powerful social groups and determines the balance of political power and economic 
            payoffs from productive and unproductive economic activities.13 Once the rules and the degree of 
            their enforcement are established, de jure and de facto political power tend to persist. When the 
            powerful elites lose political power following institutional changes, they may still exert a strong 
            influence on politics and collective action through various methods such as greater lobbying, 
            pressure, intimidation, or brute force to ensure that the new set of economic institutions does not 
            undermine their payoff.14 What delineates successful institutional changes from unsuccessful ones 
            is the existence of a critical mass of pressure groups demanding institutional changes and ensur
            ing that the institutional reforms are not undermined.15 Societies with a broad-based, pluralistic, 
            inclusive, and participatory de jure and de facto institutional framework, such as a level of judicial 
            independence,16 are significantly more prosperous in the long run than societies where the de jure 
            and de facto economic and political power are concentrated in the hands of a narrow few elites.1

         Many theories have been proposed to explain Argentina’s unique departure from being a rich 
        country on the eve of World War I to being an underdeveloped one by the early 21st century. These 
        theories emphasize institutional and noninstitutional explanations of long-run development, such 
        as different political traditions brought over by the European immigrants, the closing of the expan
        sion frontier in the Pampas with no meaningful alternatives,18 uncontrolled immigration policy, 
        which failed to encourage labor scarcity,19 and a high demographic dependence rate and the asso
        ciated low rate of national savings.20 A different strand of literature argues that, compared to the 
        United States, Argentina lacked the stock of human capital necessary to encourage broad-based, 
        innovation-driven technological progress as a vehicle of sustainable development.21 Unprece
        dented differences in human capital investment between Argentina and the United States could 
        thus explain why Buenos Aires and Chicago diverged by the late 20th century, despite sharing 
        similar historical circumstances, climatic conditions, and factor endowments. If anything, Argen
        tina’s decline has been a mere reflection of wealth implied by its core assets and fundamentals.
